const quizData = [
  {
    q: "Why does Earth’s gravity not pull the Moon down to crash into it?",
    options: ["The Moon is too light", "The Moon is moving sideways fast enough", "Earth pushes it away", "Space holds it up"],
    answer: "The Moon is moving sideways fast enough",
    explanation: "The Moon’s sideways motion balances Earth’s gravity, keeping it in orbit."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do astronauts feel weightless even though gravity still acts on them?",
    options: ["They are floating freely", "They are falling around Earth", "Gravity is weaker in space", "They are far from Earth"],
    answer: "They are falling around Earth",
    explanation: "Astronauts are in continuous free fall, creating the sensation of weightlessness."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a rocket need to push downward to go upward?",
    options: ["Gravity helps it", "Air lifts it", "Newton’s Third Law", "It’s lighter than air"],
    answer: "Newton’s Third Law",
    explanation: "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction; downward thrust creates upward motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do planets not drift away from the Sun?",
    options: ["They are stuck in space", "The Sun’s gravity pulls them", "They are not moving", "The Moon holds them"],
    answer: "The Sun’s gravity pulls them",
    explanation: "Gravity from the Sun keeps planets in orbit."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does friction always act in the opposite direction of motion?",
    options: ["To slow things down", "To balance gravity", "To help objects move", "To keep things still"],
    answer: "To slow things down",
    explanation: "Friction resists motion and acts opposite to the direction of movement."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we feel pushed back when a car suddenly speeds up?",
    options: ["Gravity increases", "Air pushes us", "Inertia resists change", "The seat moves forward"],
    answer: "Inertia resists change",
    explanation: "Your body wants to stay at rest while the car moves forward."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a soccer ball eventually stop rolling on grass?",
    options: ["Gravity pulls it down", "Friction with the grass slows it", "Air pushes it", "It runs out of energy"],
    answer: "Friction with the grass slows it",
    explanation: "Friction between the ball and grass resists motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we wear seatbelts in a moving car?",
    options: ["To stay warm", "To prevent inertia from throwing us forward", "To help us sit straight", "To reduce gravity"],
    answer: "To prevent inertia from throwing us forward",
    explanation: "Seatbelts counteract inertia during sudden stops or changes in motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a feather fall slower than a rock on Earth?",
    options: ["It’s lighter", "Air resistance affects it more", "Gravity pulls it less", "It floats"],
    answer: "Air resistance affects it more",
    explanation: "Air slows down light objects like feathers more than heavy ones."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do satellites not fall straight down to Earth?",
    options: ["They are weightless", "They are moving sideways fast enough", "Earth pushes them away", "They are held by magnets"],
    answer: "They are moving sideways fast enough",
    explanation: "Their sideways motion keeps them in orbit while gravity pulls them inward."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a book stay still on a table?",
    options: ["Gravity holds it", "Balanced forces act on it", "It’s heavy", "Air keeps it down"],
    answer: "Balanced forces act on it",
    explanation: "Gravity pulls down and the table pushes up with equal force."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a balloon fly backward when air rushes out?",
    options: ["Air pushes it", "Gravity pulls it", "It’s light", "It’s spinning"],
    answer: "Air pushes it",
    explanation: "The escaping air creates a reaction force that pushes the balloon."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we feel heavier in an elevator going up quickly?",
    options: ["Gravity increases", "Acceleration adds force", "Air pushes us down", "The elevator is fast"],
    answer: "Acceleration adds force",
    explanation: "Upward acceleration increases the normal force acting on you."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do objects in space keep moving unless stopped?",
    options: ["Gravity helps them", "Inertia keeps them moving", "Air pushes them", "They are light"],
    answer: "Inertia keeps them moving",
    explanation: "Objects in motion stay in motion unless acted on by a force."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the Moon cause tides on Earth?",
    options: ["It pushes water", "Its gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans", "It heats the oceans", "It blocks sunlight"],
    answer: "Its gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans",
    explanation: "The Moon’s gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans, causing tides."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do planets not crash into each other?",
    options: ["They are far apart", "They are held by magnets", "They are not moving", "They are pushed by the Sun"],
    answer: "They are far apart",
    explanation: "The vast distances between planets prevent collisions."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we feel lighter when a roller coaster drops suddenly?",
    options: ["Gravity disappears", "Acceleration reduces force", "Air lifts us", "The ride is fast"],
    answer: "Acceleration reduces force",
    explanation: "Downward acceleration reduces the normal force acting on you."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a soccer ball change direction when kicked?",
    options: ["Gravity pulls it", "A force acts on it", "It’s light", "Air pushes it"],
    answer: "A force acts on it",
    explanation: "The kick applies a force that changes the ball’s motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do astronauts wear suits in space?",
    options: ["To stay warm", "To protect from gravity", "To survive without air", "To float better"],
    answer: "To survive without air",
    explanation: "Space has no breathable air, so suits provide oxygen and protection."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we feel pulled toward Earth?",
    options: ["Air pushes us", "Earth’s gravity pulls us", "We are heavy", "The ground attracts us"],
    answer: "Earth’s gravity pulls us",
    explanation: "Gravity is the force that attracts us toward Earth’s center."
