const quizData = [
  {
    q: "What force keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth?",
    options: ["Magnetism", "Gravity", "Wind", "Electricity"],
    answer: "Gravity",
    explanation: "Gravity is the force that keeps celestial bodies like the Moon in orbit around planets."
  },
  {
    q: "Which of Newton’s laws explains why a ball stays still until kicked?",
    options: ["First Law", "Second Law", "Third Law", "Law of Gravity"],
    answer: "First Law",
    explanation: "Newton’s First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a force."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the unit of force?",
    options: ["Meter", "Kilogram", "Newton", "Joule"],
    answer: "Newton",
    explanation: "The unit of force is named after Sir Isaac Newton: Newton (N)."
  },
  {
    q: "Which planet has the strongest gravitational pull?",
    options: ["Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Venus"],
    answer: "Jupiter",
    explanation: "Jupiter is the largest planet and has the strongest gravity in our solar system."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do astronauts appear to float in space?",
    options: ["No gravity", "They are weightless", "Free fall around Earth", "Space pushes them up"],
    answer: "Free fall around Earth",
    explanation: "Astronauts are in continuous free fall around Earth, creating a sensation of weightlessness."
  },
  {
    q: "What causes an object to accelerate?",
    options: ["Balanced forces", "Friction", "Unbalanced forces", "Inertia"],
    answer: "Unbalanced forces",
    explanation: "Unbalanced forces cause changes in motion, including acceleration."
  },
  {
    q: "Which of these is an example of Newton’s Third Law?",
    options: ["A ball falling", "A rocket launching", "A book on a table", "A car stopping"],
    answer: "A rocket launching",
    explanation: "Newton’s Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to your weight on the Moon?",
    options: ["It increases", "It stays the same", "It decreases", "It disappears"],
    answer: "It decreases",
    explanation: "The Moon has less gravity than Earth, so your weight is less there."
  },
  {
    q: "What is inertia?",
    options: ["Force that speeds things up", "Resistance to motion change", "Gravity pull", "Push from friction"],
    answer: "Resistance to motion change",
    explanation: "Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Which force slows down a moving bicycle?",
    options: ["Gravity", "Friction", "Magnetism", "Inertia"],
    answer: "Friction",
    explanation: "Friction between the tires and the ground slows the bicycle down."
  },
  {
    q: "What causes day and night on Earth?",
    options: ["Earth’s orbit", "Earth’s rotation", "Moon blocking Sun", "Earth’s tilt"],
    answer: "Earth’s rotation",
    explanation: "Earth rotates on its axis, causing different parts to face the Sun and experience day or night."
  },
  {
    q: "What is acceleration?",
    options: ["Constant speed", "Change in speed", "Stopping", "Change in direction only"],
    answer: "Change in speed",
    explanation: "Acceleration is the rate at which an object’s speed changes over time."
  },
  {
    q: "Which planet is known for its rings?",
    options: ["Mars", "Earth", "Saturn", "Mercury"],
    answer: "Saturn",
    explanation: "Saturn is famous for its beautiful and visible ring system."
  },
  {
    q: "What keeps planets in orbit around the Sun?",
    options: ["Magnetism", "Gravity", "Wind", "Light"],
    answer: "Gravity",
    explanation: "The Sun’s gravity pulls planets into orbit around it."
  },
  {
    q: "If a box is pushed with more force, what happens?",
    options: ["It slows down", "It speeds up", "It stops", "It floats"],
    answer: "It speeds up",
    explanation: "According to Newton’s Second Law, more force results in more acceleration."
  },
  {
    q: "Which of these is NOT a planet?",
    options: ["Neptune", "Pluto", "Venus", "Moon"],
    answer: "Moon",
    explanation: "The Moon is Earth’s natural satellite, not a planet."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do we feel heavier in a fast-moving elevator going up?",
    options: ["Gravity increases", "Acceleration adds force", "Air pushes us", "Elevator is small"],
    answer: "Acceleration adds force",
    explanation: "The upward acceleration adds to the normal force, making us feel heavier."
  },
  {
    q: "What is Newton’s Second Law?",
    options: ["Force equals mass times acceleration", "Objects stay at rest", "Every action has a reaction", "Gravity pulls down"],
    answer: "Force equals mass times acceleration",
    explanation: "Newton’s Second Law: F = ma, explains how force affects motion."
  },
  {
    q: "Which of these is a balanced force scenario?",
    options: ["A book resting on a table", "A car speeding up", "A ball rolling", "A rocket launching"],
    answer: "A book resting on a table",
    explanation: "Balanced forces keep the book stationary with gravity and support force equal."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when two equal forces act in opposite directions?",
    options: ["Object speeds up", "Object slows down", "Object stays still", "Object spins"],
    answer: "Object stays still",
    explanation: "Equal and opposite forces cancel each other out, resulting in no motion."
